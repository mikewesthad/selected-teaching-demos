WEATHER + FLICKR - This is not a small assignment! 

Check out Assignment_Finished.png to see the solution in action.

The goal of this assignment is to load up a visual interface for the
OpenWeatherMap (OWM) forecast (and flex our API muscles).  We're going to 
make the weather report interactive.  When the user submits a city, the 
weather report is pulled from OWM and displayed using icons pulled from the
weather icons library.  As a bonus, a random image from a flickr search for
the city name is loaded in the background.  Oh yeah, and mix in some CSS3
animations :)

This is another synthesis challenge.  I'm giving you a starting point, but you are going to have to go out on the internet and read the documentation to figure out the specifics of what to do (links provided below).

I've provided:
	* A project with animate.css and the weather icon library already set up
	* A weather-card div that will be your template for cloning.  There's a spot for:
		- Day of the week (e.g. MON, TUES, etc.)
		- A weather icon (see api-list link under Weather Icons)
		- A wind direction icon
		- A wind speed icon (beaufort wind scale)
		- High & low temperatures
	* A form with a text input (that has autocomplete turned off)
	* A full screen background image div that can take a flickr URL 

I'm going to give you the order in which you should tackle the parts of this project:
	1. When a user submits a city, you call the OWM API
	2. The day of the week and high & low temperatures are displayed
	3. The corresponding weather icons are loaded
	4. When a user submits a city, you also call the flickr API and find a random image to load in the background div.
	5. When the weather reports are loaded on the screen, instead of appearing immediately, they fade in using animate.css

OpenWeatherMap API:
	* http://openweathermap.org/api
	* http://openweathermap.org/forecast16

Weather Icons:
	* They are like fontawesome!  You add a special class name to an <i> element and it automagically becomes an icon.
	* Overview of weather icons: http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/
	* For how to generate a weather icon from the weather IDs that OWM provides: http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/api-list.html
	* For wind speed icons: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_scale

Flickr:
	* You'll probably want to do a search for photos using "method=flickr.photos.search".
	* Sorting the search results by "interestingness" would be smart.
	* Relevant documentation:
		- https://www.flickr.com/services/api/
		- https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.overview.html
		- https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html
	* You have to do a little work to construct an image URL from a search result: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html

General tips
	* COMMENT YOUR CODE!  Leave notes that explain what the different parts of 
	  your program do.
	* Debug small chunks of code and debug often.  Don't try to code 
	  everything all at once!
	* Plan before you start coding.  Paper & pencil are helpful in wrapping
	  your head around a problem.
