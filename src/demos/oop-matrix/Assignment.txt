Matrixâ„¢ Falling Text

Synthesis time!  We're trying to achieve a matrix-y effect with a particle system - you can see a snapshot of the result in Assignment_Solution.png.

You are going to want a CharacterParticle class and then a CharacterParticleGroup class.  The setup is similar to ball particle exercise, except for three things:
	1. When you draw the particle, you draw a letter instead of an ellipse.  You'll want to figure out a way to make that letter change every time you update the particle.
	2. Instead of bouncing, these particles wrap around the screen.  E.g. if one moves off the bottom edge of the screen, it should appear at the top of the screen.
	3. The screen needs to be cleared using a transparent color (e.g. background(0, 10)) in order to get a motion trail effect.

New p5 variables and functions:
	textSize(...)
	text(...)
	textFont(...) -> Use a font from your computer. Note: you can see the 
	                 fonts on your computer using http://wordmark.it/

We're giving you a function to get a random character (getRandomCharacter) in sketch.js.  You can (and should) use that code inside of a class when you are ready.

BONUSES:
	1. Use map(...) to make the x and y velocity of the particles map to the mouse's x and y position. 
	2. Now use map(...) to control the color of the particles using the mouse position.  You'll probably want to use colorMode(...) to switch to HSB.
